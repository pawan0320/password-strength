Project Overview: Password Strength Assessment Tool

Project Objective:

The goal of this project is to develop a tool that assesses the strength of passwords entered by users and provides real-time feedback on how secure their passwords are. This tool will evaluate various factors such as password length, complexity (use of different character types), and uniqueness to guide users in creating stronger, more secure passwords.

Key Features:
Password Input Field:

A form where users can input their password.
Real-Time Feedback:

As the user types, the tool will analyze the password and give immediate feedback.
A visual indicator (progress bar, color codes) will show the password strength (e.g., Weak, Medium, Strong).
Password Strength Criteria:

Length: Passwords should have a minimum of 8 characters (with recommendations for longer passwords).
Character Variety: The tool will check for the inclusion of:
Uppercase letters (A-Z)
Lowercase letters (a-z)
Numbers (0-9)
Special characters (!, @, #, $, etc.)
Uniqueness: It will discourage the use of common passwords (like "password123") or patterns (like "abc", "123").
Feedback Mechanism:

Message Display: Show suggestions to users on how to improve their password.
If the password lacks complexity, a message like “Add numbers or special characters to strengthen your password.”
Visual Feedback: A color-coded progress bar where:
Red indicates a weak password.
Yellow indicates a moderate password.
Green indicates a strong password.
Password Score: A numeric score (0-100) that reflects the strength based on the algorithm.
Common Password Database Check:

The tool will cross-check the password against a list of commonly used passwords and alert the user if the password is too weak or common.
Additional Features:

Password validation against organizational or security policies.
A toggle option to view or hide the password.
Encouragement for password managers if users struggle with creating unique passwords.

Technical Components:

Frontend:

HTML/CSS/JavaScript: The user interface for the password entry and feedback.
JavaScript will handle real-time password validation.
Password Feedback: Visual elements such as a progress bar and text messages will be updated using JavaScript based on password quality.
Backend (Optional):
Python/Django or Node.js: To handle more complex logic like querying a database of common passwords or applying custom password rules.
REST API: If this tool is part of a larger system, an API can be created to validate passwords server-side.
Password Strength Algorithm:
Length: Scoring based on the number of characters (longer passwords score higher).
Character Variety: Higher scores for passwords that include a mix of:
Uppercase and lowercase letters.
Numbers.
Special characters.
Uniqueness: Penalties for passwords found in common password databases.
Entropy Calculation: Using entropy to assess how difficult the password would be to crack.

User Flow:

Input: User types in a password.

Real-Time Assessment: As the user types, the password is analyzed in real time.

Feedback: The user receives both visual (progress bar) and textual feedback about password strength.
Improvement Suggestions: If weak, the tool will suggest ways to strengthen the password.
Potential Libraries/Tools:

zxcvbn.js: A JavaScript library for password strength estimation.
pwgen: For generating secure random passwords.
Regular Expressions: Used for pattern matching and assessing password complexity.

Future Extensions:

Integration with Signup Forms: This tool can be integrated into registration forms to ensure users are creating strong passwords.
Password Expiry & Change Notifications: Can be extended to include password expiry checks for users.
Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): As a recommendation for additional security, users can be prompted to enable 2FA.
